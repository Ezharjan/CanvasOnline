# Introduction

Pointless is an endless drawing canvas that provides useful features when you're
in need for a simple whiteboard/note app.

It is build using Tauri (Rust) and React with a pure SVG canvas and local files
are saved with brotli compression to ensure small file sizes.

‚ùóÔ∏è Currently, this app can only be build locally. Anytime soon there will be
public releases available with prebuild binaries for MacOS, Windows and Linux.

we'll discuss it.
